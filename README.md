# About
*This project has our group creating a web-application that uses at least two api calls. Our team created U-Hike, a user friendly web-application that takes the users locations and returns information on trails/hiking locations in the nearby area. Once the trails information appears, the user can then select a trail and get directions. The directions page will load with coordinates from your current location to the location of the trail. All in a user-friendly and easily accessible location, for all hikers alike.  

*The api's used are: google directions, google maps, and trails API. 
*CSS Library: Semantic UI

# Contributions
* As of now, this repository should only be changed/altered via Vanderbilt University professors and TA's from the bootcamp as well as the contributors.
